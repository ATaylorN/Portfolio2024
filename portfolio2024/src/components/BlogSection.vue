        <h2>Weekly Recap (2/25/24 - 3/2/24): WordPress</h2>
        <p>📚 This week was all about learning, so I spent most of my time on LinkedIn Learning courses:<br>

        <br>
        ✅PHP for WordPress<br>
        ✅Creating Block Patterns in WordPress<br>
        ✅WordPress Content Blocks: Working with Themes<br>
        ✅WordPress: Staging a Site<br>
        ✅WordPress: Contact Forms<br>
        ✅WordPress: E-commerce<br>
        ✅WordPress: Building a Secure Site<br>

        <br>
        I may have had a theme. I've spent some time in the past couple of weeks learning WordPress, but this week, 
        I really wanted to do a deep dive and ensure that I have a strong knowledge base. <br>

        <br>
        💻 I've always been fascinated by frontend development and design in general, which is why I love Frontend Mentor. 
        If you're also into frontend and haven't heard of Frontend Mentor yet, I highly recommend checking them out. They have 
        a variety of challenges to choose from. They give you an image of a website, and the challenge is to create a site that 
        is as similar to that image as possible. I recently completed one of their challenges and created a recipe page (https://lnkd.in/gc_gXAcM) 
        and have also started another challenge to create a landing page. <br>
        <br>
        📰 I also spent some time experimenting with WordPress and started building out a website based on the Dungeons and Dragons campaign I'm currently in. <br>
        <br>
        🎶 And without further ado, the unhinged Spotify playlist of the week is..."Rap Metal Academic" 🤷‍♀️ 🤣

        <h2>Weekly Recap (2/18/24 - 2/24/24): Recovery from Rejection</h2>
        <p>This week:<br>

        <br>
        💻I completed some more LinkedIn Learning courses: Creating a Responsive Web Design and WordPress.com Essential Training (last week’s was on WordPress.org).<br>
        <br>
        📊I completed an Excel project that focused heavily on creating dashboards.<br>
        <br>
        📚I read a book called ‘Imposter No More: Overcome Imposterism to Cultivate a Successful Career’ by Jill A. Stoddard, started to learn guitar, 
        and pulled out my sketchbook for the first time in quite a while.<br>
        <br>
        If I’m being completely honest, I didn’t feel as productive this week as I have been in the past. Mid-week, I received a particularly painful 
        rejection from a job I wanted and I felt that I needed a moment to recover. So I took a little break, which may or may not have included getting 
        poké for lunch and a trip to MicroCenter.<br>
        <br>
        Now it’s time to get back to it👩‍💻

        <h4>February 16th, 2024</h4>
        <h2>Weekly Recap (2/11/24 - 2/17/24): Portfolio Optimization</h2>
        <p>Thought I'd start giving recaps on my week so here goes:<br>

        <br>
        📖 This week, I completed 2 projects on data cleaning & exploration using SQL. I also completed various LinkedIn Learning courses including UX Design
         (a 7-part course), Figma for UX Design, and WordPress Essential Training.<br> 

        <br> 
        🖥 I also did a lot of work on my portfolio site. I started the week off by creating a logo, figuring out how to get the page title to change when using 
        a router in Vue as you navigate to different pages, and reworking my GitHub so that when you navigate from my site to different projects, it makes more 
        sense. I wanted to make it so that the profile page isn't as long and when you click 'View Project' on my site, it takes you to the code, where the readMe 
        file now has all of the photos, descriptions, what I learned, etc. Then, I deployed it...and immediately had to fix a couple of things lol. It wasn't too 
        bad; I just noticed that, for some reason, the LinkedIn and GitHub buttons at the top of my page weren't working. Once that was taken care of, I ran Lighthouse 
        and worked on increasing my accessibility and SEO scores. I sent my site to some people for feedback and to just test it in general and picked up on an 
        interesting issue that I didn't anticipate (glad I asked). In my portraits section, when you click on a portrait, you can't select any of the buttons I created 
        underneath the portrait when you're using an iPhone 12. My buttons are covered up by buttons that are built into the iPhone. It's an easy enough fix, just 
        need to adjust the height of the cards.<br>  

        <br> 
        🎵 Bonus: my "most unhinged Spotify playlist name" for the week (because I'm getting a kick out of their DayList feature) - I was thinking 
        "Terror Horrorcore Monday Afternoon" because that felt like a lot for a Monday, but then Spotify hit me with the "Chill Rock Always Single 
        Wednesday Afternoon" on Valentine's Day, which...rude 🤣

        <h4>February 9th, 2024</h4>
        <h2>Portfolio Updates!</h2>
        <p>"But why tho? I liked your last one!" I get it; I didn't hate the previous version of my portfolio site. But since the time
            that I had initially created it, I've learned a lot and I wanted a way to showcase that. I probably could've 
            just thrown in a new section for the new skills, but a couple of weeks ago, I was hit with a spark of inspiration and it led 
            to me completely redoing my site. So new year, new...site. On the plus side, this project was a great refresher on frontend development and overall design.

        <h4>February 9th, 2024</h4>
        <h2>New Skills Acquired</h2>
        <p>Since graduating Tech Elevator, I've continued to learn as much as possible about software development. At first, I'll admit, I didn't really have 
            a direction, but as I was applying to jobs, the companies that were interested in me primarily used Python. Since I'm most familiar with Java, I
            decided that learning Python would be my next challenge.<br><br>
            I spent about two months going through LinkedIn Learning classes and even an online MIT class. 
            While I was working on this, I was also going through the interview process for a data analyst position so I quickly added data analytics, Excel (specifically things
            like pivot tables), tableau, pandas, and more to my list of things to learn, going through even more LinkedIn Learning classes and going so far as to watch a 19 
            hour data anayltics video on YouTube. <br><br>
            Ultimately, I didn't get that data analyst position. They found a candidate that was just a bit more of what they were looking for which was heart-breaking.
            On the bright side, I have all of this additional knowledge and skills that I didn't have before. And I know that if I'm up for another data analyst position,
            I'll be that much more prepared.
