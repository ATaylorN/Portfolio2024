# Portfolio Site 
> A portfolio website to highlight my coding projects, marketing experience, and artistic abilities

The first thing that I did was spend hours designing and redesigning my site in Figma. My focus was on how I can make my site easy to navigate and display my projects in a way that is understandable to someone even if they are not a programmer. I also wanted to make it as easy as possible for a recruiter or potential client to be able to contact me so I used email.js to code the ability to email me directly from my site. The user can either click the 'email' icon on the home page or use the footer (which also makes it so that you can contact me regardless of what page of my site you're on). I also liked the idea of putting my resume on my site, but didn't want to simply uplaod my actual resume. My solution was to create a timeline and a seperate section that lists my technical skills.

## Sections On My Site Include:

### Coding Projects  

Projects include a meal planner application that I worked on with three other Tech Elevator graduates, a flash cards application that I created to study Java, my personal portfolio site, and a library application that I'm currently working on.  

### Data Analysis & Python  

Currently still being built, but a section to showcase projects where I've gone through large data sets, formatted the data so that it was consistent and easier to manipulate, and ran multiple SQL queries to analyze the data. I'm also currently working on projects where I utilize Tableau to build visualizations and Python to pull data from external websites.  

### Marketing 

Campaigns that I worked on as a transaction coordinator for a real estate team. Individual Realtors and Real Estate Teams need a ton of marketing to get in front of potential home-seller and home-buying clients and stay top of mind. This can mean numerous social media campaigns, listing presentations, events, brochures, email campaigns, and brochures (just to name a few!)  

### Graphite Portraits  

Using primarily graphite pencil with the occasional acrylic paint for a pop of color, each portrait takes roughly 40+ hours. I've drawn characters from several of my favorite shows, movies, video games, along with the occasional commission.  

### Blog  

A blog I've created so that I can share resources I've found, talk about what I've learned, and share what my experience as a junior software developer has been like.
